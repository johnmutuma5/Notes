# Data Visualisation
Helps replace cognition with perception in datasets

## The need for data vis over statistical summaries
See the Anscombe's Quartet to understand why it is important to do data visualisation on top of making statistical inferences from statistical summaries alone.

## Inputs for data visualisation
Data and Tasks. There are broadly three dataset types that we can encounter in data visualisation;
- Tables
  - Two dimensional and multi dimensional
- Networks
  - Graphs and trees
- Spatial data
  - Fields and Geometry

We can identify two attribute types for tabular data;
- Categorical - distinctly different items with no intrinsic ordering
- Ordered
  - Ordinal
  - Quantitative
