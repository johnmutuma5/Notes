# Django Deep Dive
**NB:** This is the second item of Django series of notes. You may want to check the previous item(s) first.

The project used in these notes for demonstration is called [deeperdive](http:// 'deeperdive project'). Clone it from Github or follow along remotely as we go through the notes.

# The ORM!!

```Py
# blog/models.py

from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class Entry(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    pub_date = models.DateField()
    body = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

```

`>>> from blog.models import Entry`

`>>> entries = Entry.objects.all()`

The command above translates to the following SQL expression;

```SQL
SELECT blog_entry.id,
       blog_entry.pub_date,
       blog_entry.body,
       blog_entry.title
FROM blog_entry;
```
`>>> entries`

This produces a list of Entry objects;

`[<Entry: Entry Title1>, <Entry: Entry Title2]`

How does this happen?
