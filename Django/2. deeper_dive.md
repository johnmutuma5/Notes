## Add static root

To point Django to where our static files including `CSS` and `JavaScript` will be placed, we shall go to `settings.py` and find the setting called `STATIC_URL`. Close to it, we will ensure that we have the `STATIC_ROOT` setting is declared.

```Py
# settings.py
# ...
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
#...
```
