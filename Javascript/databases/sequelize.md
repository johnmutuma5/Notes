## Getting started
The first thing we need to do is to install the sequelize module in the project as a production dependency `npm install --save sequelize`.
From the [documentation](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/installation/getting-started.html#installation), select one of the database adapters according to the database you're using. e.g. `npm install --save pg pg-hstore` for PostgreSQL.

### Loading sequelize
To load sequelize, we simply `require` it:

```js
// app.js
const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
```

Note the capitalization of `Sequelize` above, because the on `requiring`, we get a contructor function that should be invoked with the `new` keyword.

### Creating a connection
There are two ways through which we can connect to the database after installing the modules above.

First, we can use a bare string representing the database URI:
```js
// app.js
const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
const connection = new Sequelize('postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname', {});
```

The second argument in the constructor above is an object of options. You can see the [API Reference](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/class/lib/sequelize.js~Sequelize.html) for a whole range of options available.

The alternative way of creating a connection to the database is by using the following criteria;

```js
// app.js
const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
const connection = new Sequelize('database_name', 'user', 'password', {
    dialect: 'postgres'
});
```

### Creating a table
After the connection has successfully been created, we can now perform database transactions like creating a table as follows;

```js
// app.js
const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
const connection = new Sequelize('database_name', 'user', 'password', {
    dialect: 'postgres'
});

// create a table users
const User = connection.define('users', {
    name: Sequelize.STRING,
    home_area: Sequelize.STRING
});

connection.sync();
```
The script above will create a table `users` in the database with the specified fields. In addition, we get some extra fields including `id` which is a database autogenerated sequence of record `id`s, `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are also autogenerated database `TIMESTAMP`s. With regards to the autogenerated fields, we can have control which we'll see later in these notes.

### Creating a record
`connection.sync()` is asynchronous and returns `Promise` object after it has synced with the database. After the `promise` has resolved, we can go ahead and create a record as follows;

```js
// app.js
// ...

connection.sync()
    .then(function() {
        User.create({
            name: 'Laz',
            home_area: 'Kiambu Rd'
        });
    });

```
